###THis is a simple Python calculator created using the eval function.


There are shortcomings to this method

The result will always be a float

Please enter a regular expression like 2*3+5 and the calculator will calculate

The primary function of this is not to be a two digit calculator that takes separate input for operations and variables

There is a try catch block to handle simple errors

Hope you Enjoy!
